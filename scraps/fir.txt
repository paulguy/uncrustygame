buffers:
 input
 filter
 slice
 accumulator
 output

for each requested sample
 fetch input sample
 determine filter slice to use from slice buffer sample
 apply to accumulator for each filter sample
 put first item in accumulator buffer to output
 advance input, slice, accumulator and output pointers
 as accumulator pointer advances, it'll usually split between its end and
 beginning, so it needs to be done in 2 parts.
 if any buffers run out (except of course filter), stop and return the amount
 of samples that could be completed
