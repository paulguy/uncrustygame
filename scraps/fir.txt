buffers:
 input
 internal buffer (filter size - 1, initialized with silence)
 filter (filter size)
 slice
 accumulator (filter size)
 output

output what's available from internal buffer
fill internal buffer with input
if internal + remaining input buffer < filter size
 do nothing more
else
 for each requested sample
  fetch input samples starting from internal buffer then remaining
   input buffer
  determine filter slice to use from slice buffer sample
  apply to accumulator for each filter sample
  put first item in accumulator buffer to output
  advance input, slice, accumulator and output pointers
   (input pointers may be split between internal buffer and input
    buffer)
  as accumulator pointer advances, it'll usually split between its end and
  beginning, so it needs to be done in 2 parts.
  if any buffers run out (except of course filter), stop and return the amount
  of samples that could be completed
 fill internal buffer with remaining requested samples from input
  buffer to continue with on next call
