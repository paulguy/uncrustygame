sequencer format for crustygame synthesizer

initial global state
 magic
 version
 sequence name
 speed
 buffers start
 channels start
 patterns start
 patterns order start

buffers
 number of buffers
buffer
 buffer name
 name of a wav file
 start sample
 end sample

channels (player objects) initial state
 number of channels
channel
 channel name
 input buffer
 input buffer pos
 output mode
 volume mode
 volume
 volume source
 mode
 loop start
 loop end
 phase source
 speed mode
 speed
 speed source
 audio balance
 running
 run length

patterns
 number of patterns
pattern
 pattern length in bytes
 pattern length in rows
 each column is a channel
 each row has a bitfield indicating global, channel and/or player state changes
 for each channel, followed by the state changes
 global
  speed (1)
 channel
  all from initial state (16)
 commands (6)
  stop note behavior
  input buffer end behavior
  volume source end behavior
  phase source end behavior
  speed source end behavior
  run length end behavior
 everything from bitfield follows in order

behavior
 another row which is applied on various events, stored as a pointer, so they
 can "cascasde"

pattern order
 number of pattern orders
 order of patterns
